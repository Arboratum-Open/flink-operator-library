# flink-operator-library

The library provides a set of [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org) operators and supporting utilities. Please visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/ottogroup/flink-operator-library/wiki/) to learn more about the implemented components. Amongst them you will find 

* [a JSON based content filter](https://github.com/ottogroup/flink-operator-library/wiki/JSON-Content-Filter-operator)
* [an integration with flink-spector to allow testing of JSON based operators](https://github.com/ottogroup/flink-operator-library/wiki/JSON%20Content%20Matcher%20to%20integrate%20with%20Flink%20Spector%20for%20operator%20and%20pipeline%20testing)
* [JSON processing utilities](https://github.com/ottogroup/flink-operator-library/wiki/JSON%20processing%20utilities)
* [an abstract runtime foundation for streaming applications to speed up development](https://github.com/ottogroup/flink-operator-library/wiki/Base-runtime-for-streaming-applications)  
* [a selector implementation to extract keys from JSON documents](https://github.com/ottogroup/flink-operator-library/wiki/JSON-document-backed-key-selector)
